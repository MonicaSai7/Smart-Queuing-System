# Smart-Queuing-System

## Main Tasks
The following pages will walk you through the steps of the project. At a high level, you will:
1. Propose a possible hardware solution
2. Build out your application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
3. Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best
4. Revise your proposal based on the test results

## Part 1: Hardware Proposal
### The Scenarios
We've provided three different scenarios that depict real-world problems based on different sectors where edge devices are typically deployed.

The three scenarios you'll be looking at are:

Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector<br>
Scenario 2: Retail Sector<br>
Scenario 3: Transportation Sector
